    "\n",
    "The easiest method would be to just take the difference. This is definitely the most intuitive way, however **price differences** are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested $\\$$1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from $\\$$100 to $\\$$102 and stock B moves from $\\$$10 to $\\$$11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ($\\$1000 \\ / \\ \\$100 = 10$) which led to a profit of $10 \\cdot (\\$102 - \\$100) = \\$20$ and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded \\$100. So the price increase was larger for stock **A**, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the **stock return**. In our example, the return for stock A was $\\frac{\\$102 - \\$100 }{\\$100} = 2\\%$, while for stock B it was $\\frac{\\$11 - \\$10 }{\\$10} = 10\\%$. The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns are widely used in finance, however **log returns** are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling $S_t$ the price of the stock $S$ at time $t$, we can define the log return between $t_1$ and $t_2$ as:\n",

    "r_{t_1, t_2} = \\log \\left( \\frac{S_{t_2}}{S_{t_1}} \\right)\n",

    "- they are additive across time $r_{t_1, t_2} + r_{t_2, t_3} = r_{t_1, t_3}$\n",
